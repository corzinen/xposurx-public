# xposurx

Xposurx is a application that allows you to capture risks and quantify their exposures in your environment.

Its designed to be compact and easy to use while empowering effective measurement and management of risks within projects or organizations. The app offers a range of features that cover the entire risk management lifecycle, from risk identification to the optimization of mitigating investments. The app is designed to be used by a wide range of users, from risk analysts to project managers, and can be used to manage risks in a variety of contexts, from single projects to entire organizations.

# Key Features

### Risk Register Creation

Users can easily create and maintain a detailed risk register. Likelihood and impact estimates can be assigned to each risk, and the app will automatically calculate the risk exposure. Risks can be categorized and filtered by various criteria. A variety of impact types are pre-defined with configurable loss tables and distributions. xposurx's OpenFAIR-based cost model provides a comprehensive approach to gaining insights of potential losses.

### Monte Carlo Simulation for Risk Quantification

xposurx employs Monte Carlo simulation techniques to quantify risks, allowing users to model uncertainties and assess the likelihood and impact of various risk scenarios.

### Control Effectiveness Estimation & Assignment

Users can estimate the effectiveness of different controls and interventions, aiding in the selection of the most suitable risk mitigation measures. It allows users to assign specific controls to individual risks, creating a streamlined approach to risk management.

### Risk Treatment Optimization

xposurx allows users to evaluate risk tolerances and optimize their risk treatment strategies, helping them to identify the most cost-effective risk mitigation measures.

### Residual Risk Loss Estimation

Calculate residual risks and estimate potential losses with insurance coverage to get a more accurate picture of the overall risk landscape.

### Strategic Prioritization through Mitigation Portfolios

Users can prioritize actions by creating and quantitatively analyzing mitigation portfolios, helping them focus resources on the most critical risks and potential impacts.
